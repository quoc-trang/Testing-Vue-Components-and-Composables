# useRefHistory Composable Test Challenge

Your task is to create a test for the `useRefHistory` composable that we created earlier in the training.

## Requirements

1. Fill out all the tests in `useRefHistory.test.ts`

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Feel free to use TypeScript to make your tests type safe if you'd like. This is NOT required however.

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Run the tests with `yarn test:unit`
